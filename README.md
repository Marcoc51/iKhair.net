# iKhair.net Dashboard
Welcome to the iKhair.net dashboard repository. iKhair.net is a mobile app that has been in the market since 2011, with over 10 million records in its database for user profiles, transactions, and location.

This dashboard, built using Microsoft Power BI, allows users to segment the app's users based on similarities in their data. By analyzing and visualizing the data, you can gain valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, and use this information to tailor your marketing and product development efforts.

To use the dashboard, you will need to have a Power BI account and the Power BI desktop application installed on your machine. Once you have these tools set up, you can clone or download the repository and open the `iKhair-net.pbix` file in Power BI desktop. From there, you can customize the dashboard to your needs, by changing the data sources, filters, and visualizations.
